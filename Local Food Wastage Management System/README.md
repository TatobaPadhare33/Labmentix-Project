# Food Management System

## Overview
The Food Management System is a web-based solution designed to reduce food wastage by connecting surplus food providers (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) with receivers such as NGOs and shelters. The platform enables fast, transparent, and efficient redistribution of food resources, fostering social responsibility and sustainability.

## Features
- Centralized dashboard for surplus food listings, claims, statistics, and notifications.
- Real-time interaction between providers and receivers.
- Analysis of food donation and claim rates by location, meal type, food type, and participant activity.
- Data analytics using Python, Pandas, and interactive Streamlit app.
- Secure management with validation, role-based access, and encrypted passwords.
